# Beginner-Friendly C++ Arithmetic Operators and Math Logic

**Make sure to not skip the theory before doing practise.**

In this lesson, we’ll do **more complex arithmetic operators** and some math logic which will become very handy in the future, believe me.

## Features

- Demonstrates **Arithmetic Operators**:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
- Explains **Increment (`++`)** and **Decrement (`--`)** operators.
- Showcases the importance of **Order of Operations** using parentheses.
- Covers the difference between **Integer Division** and **Floating-Point Division**.
- Provides practical examples, such as:
  - Calculating the average of three numbers.
  - Finding the area of a circle.

### Math Logic
- **Increment/Decrement:** Explains how to add or subtract 1 from a variable.
- **Order of Operations:** Shows how parentheses affect calculations.
- **Practical Calculations:**
    - Calculates the average of three numbers.
    - Computes the area of a circle using the formula **PI * radius * radius**.

## Wrapping Up

By the end of this lesson, you’ll have learned:
- How to use all of the arithmetic operators
- Understand how maths work in C++
- Performing advanced math operations

### Practice Exercises

Create a program that:
1. Calculates and prints the average of 3-9 numbers.
2. Calculate the circumference and area of a circle
3. Calculate a variable using all arithmetic Operators and printing it in the end.

### Formulas for practise exercises
Formula for the Area of a circle:
**PI * radius * radius**

Formula for the Circumference of the circle:
**2 * PI * radius**
